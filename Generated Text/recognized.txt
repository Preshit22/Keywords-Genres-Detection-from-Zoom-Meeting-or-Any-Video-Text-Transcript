I am someone who keeps talking about being in the present and it's not something that I keep saying you know it's something that I truly believe in and I feel it's always important to be in the present focus in the present because what I am doing in the present will have an impact on the future and you have to be slightly ahead you have to be slightly out of the box but at the same time keeping it simple is something that is the key keep it simple but at the same time look to improve and that's what is something that's very important you are not to throw in the towel till the result is there in often you know what we have seen in our support also open it happens that you know a few runs are needed the Wicket is Flat they have more wickets in the dressing room then what happens if you tend to back of saying ok we have lost this game and let's look for the next one but what's important to still give in your best and still try to win
try to win the game from that position and can still get a lot of positives out of it in a you think that slowly ok you are on track and you are started to achieve what you really wanted to achieve but again next year becomes part of the process because once you are at the top the people who want to catch up they always they want like everybody wants to be at the top slot so it's always the process and you always have to keep improving yourself you have to keep learning from the mistakes that you make in the even if you are at the top you will still commit a lot of mistakes and those are the learning curve that actually help you in the future I feel for me most of the time is good time either you are learning for your enjoying what you have learnt so it's not the option the down you lose some you win some when you when you celebrate when you lose you learn English
selected but again worry about the controllable you know and whatever the controllables are we take care of it will get the desired result if we don't get the desired result will improve will change our plans will execute better and will get get a chance to prove ourselves again so that's what it is thinking about the result never gives you result may have a target in mind but what is more important is to take care of the small steps in life you know what needs to be done what I am supposed to do what extra I can do and you know that will help us achieve the target you know that's what makes you more and more successful in life when you go through the apps and the downside the same time I think I am as each and every individual is we all feel the frustration we all feel the irritation when things are not going away but what is important is you know does frustration lead to anything that is good for the team you know what that that that that that that that
at that point of time what I am thinking is what needs to be done you know I would say that you know I feel equally frustrated I also feel angry at times I feel disappointed but what is important is none of these are constructed in what needs to be done right now is more important than any of these emotions so when I get into the thinking of what needs to be Nabi Mujhe Kya Karna Hai what is the next thing that I can plan who is the individual I can use and once I get into it you know I am controlling my emotions in the much better way so I would say I am like everyone else it's just that I control my emotions slightly better than some of the Other individual you know it will be wrong to say that you know these are something that doesn't come to my mind yes you know I also face each and everything but always felt that my emotions should be under my control and if I am able to do that then I thinking thinking thinking thinking thinking thin
my thinking will be more constructive and also it will help me think more about the process then the result because result can put undue pressure on on the individual or as a team in in the food so I feel all the small small things which fall into places which may or may not be in your control also contribute a lot but the most important ingredient yes hard work is there dedication is their passion is there but I felt being honest is one of the most important thing P to start of being honest to yourself unless you are honest to yourself you can't be honest to others and what it also does it helps you in accepting what the shortcomings are you may not be a great player you know may not be a great human being but if you are willing to accept the shortcomings you can always look to improve you can go to people you can ask for help and they will be people to guide you out whether it's your seniors whether it's your parents close friends forever those
those maybe and always felt all these things really helped me keep moving ahead in life you know throughout being honest towards the goal what is the goal the goal is not to for me it was never to score so many runs for India for me it was always you know how will be able to win a game whether you are the captain of you are not the captain what you want is you know how much you have contributed for the team to win and you know if let's say if I am not an athlete if I have if I am not a professional cricketer or a badminton player but if I played in a sport in school it becomes like a culture you know and it helps you stay fit in life so if you have support everyday as part of your life even after you get a employment with any institution you will make sure you take some time out out of it you know so that you are going to let's say badminton court or tennis court to go and play some kind of sport so even if nothing it helps you be fit it
it's you be fit but as I said if you're playing let's say till 4th everybody place for let se from class 6 onwards to 12th also if your participating in sports that's the chunk of time where you learn a lot about life and as I said when you are in support your competing against someone you will win some you lose some it will teach you about the mistakes that you have committed in it will teach you how to get out of it how you can get demolished out of it and also in life that's what it's all about you can get walked down by the losses that you have had always have to look up you have to take things in your stride and you have to accept the mistakes that you have made you know a lot of times we don't accept the shortcomings that we have to accept that ok this some shortcoming in me or my game because that's how you improve yourself to be honest in life you have to be honest to yourself
you have to be practical you have to take risk in life but at the same time no you you have to be calculated you can't just say OK I took a risky option at some point of time you have to be ready with ready for the kind of talent that's really needed to achieve what you want to achieve but at the same time you have to take risk in life so for me being honest in life is very important hard work that you have to put in the irrespective of what your profession is the hard work the honesty respecting the elders which I feel is the keep you know if you don't respect your parents or beat anyone in it becomes very difficult to be successful in life being humble you know right from the first man you meet to maybe the Managing Director you have to be the same to each and everyone so that's what life is all about go through the difficult periods fight it out but if you can do it with a smile you know that you will become
you will become part of maybe the 5% persons you know who can actually do it because at times we Crepe about life about the tough period but the tough period that actually make you a better human being
